          <strong>Terms of Use:</strong> <br />
          You must follow any policies made available to you within the
          Services. Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with
          our Services or try to access them using a method other than the
          interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our
          Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and
          re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop
          providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or
          policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct. Using our
          Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
          rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use
          content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner
          or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the
          right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove,
          obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our
          Services. Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This
          content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it
          available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or
          violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content
          that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that
          does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t
          assume that we do. In connection with your use of the Services, we may
          send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other
          information. You may opt out of some of those communications. Some of
          our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services
          in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or
          safety laws. <br />

          <strong>Your account</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          You may need a UBPlatform Account in order to use some of our
          Services. You may create your own UBPlatform Account, or your
          UBPlatform Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as
          your employer or educational institution. If you are using a
          UBPlatform Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or
          additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to
          access or disable your account. To protect your UBPlatform Account,
          keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity
          that happens on or through your UBPlatform Account. Try not to reuse
          your UBPlatform Account password on third-party applications. If you
          learn of any unauthorized use of your password or UBPlatform Account,
          follow these instructions.

          <strong>Your Content in our Services</strong>
          <br />
          Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or
          receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property
          rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you
          stays yours. When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content
          to or through our Services, you give UBPlatform (and those we work
          with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify,
          create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations,
          adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better
          with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly
          display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this
          license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and
          improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license
          continues even if you stop using our Services. Some Services may offer
          you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that
          Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings
          that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those
          Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this
          license for any content that you submit to our Services. Our automated
          systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you
          personally relevant product features, such as customized search
          results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This
          analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is
          stored. If you have a UBPlatform Account, we may display your Profile
          name, Profile photo, and actions you take on UBPlatform or on
          third-party applications connected to your UBPlatform Account (such as
          +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services,
          including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will
          respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings
          in your UBPlatform Account. For example, you can choose your settings
          so your name and photo do not appear in an ad. You can find more
          information about how UBPlatform uses and stores content in the
          privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you
          submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your
          feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

        <strong>About Software in our Services</strong>
        <br />
        When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software
        may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is
        available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update
        settings. UBPlatform gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to
        you by UBPlatform as part of the Services. This license is for the sole
        purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as
        provided by UBPlatform, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may
        not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or
        included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract
        the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those
        restrictions or you have our written permission. Open source software is
        important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under
        an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be
        provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of
        these terms.
